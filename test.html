    No matter which historical period you choose;  It is more likely that there is a war being fought on some front, which is being paid by many people who do not have a choice.
    Unfortunately;  War is part of our human history, and throughout the known path of humankind, wars have led - and still lead - to many tragedies and sufferings for humanity, but when looking at wars objectively and far from emotional;  There is usually a set of common things that unite them, and departing from them means that a war is strange.
    In this article, we will review some of the strangest of these wars in human history, some of them were very short, or perhaps they lasted too long and did not include real events, or they were simply different from the remaining wars.

<h3>Shortest War in History :just 38 Minutes</h3><br><br><br>

<pre>When talking about wars, what comes to mind are long and devastating armed conflicts,
 as wars usually extend for many years and sometimes even decades, leaving behind gigantic
human and financial damages and scars that are not easily erased from the minds of thoseho
contemplate them, but the very short war between England and Zanzibar completely broke the 
It did not end within a month or even days, but rather it ended after only 38 minutes from
and as expected it was a landslide victory for the EnglishThe main cause of the war was fg
 the sudden death of the Sultan of Zanzibar in 1896, and with this sultan beingmore like an 
reality, it wasnever acceptable to the English when his nephew came to power,bypassing prev
conditions thatrequired the British approval of the candidate for the Sultanate before  To 
As a result,the British threatened war quickly, and asked the new sultan to abdicate his 
, or else theywould make a quick landing and forcibly remove him.n any case;  It was not 
and the morning after the new sultan assumed his throne, the British Navy began bombing the 
and infantry began to advance quickly, crushing any easily existing defenses.  In just 38 minutes, 
new sultan had fled his burning palace, leaving the throne to a new sultan chosen by the English 
they had stripped many of the powers from the title.</pre>

    <h2>The Scound World War</h2>
    <pre>The Second World War is an international war that began on the first of
    September 1939 in Europe and ended on the second of September 1945, in
    which the vast majority of countries in the world, including the great powers
    participated in two rival military allies: the Allied Forces and the Axis Powers,
    and it is the broader war.  In history, more than 100 million people from more
    than 30 countries participated directly in it, and the major countries have put
    all their military, economic, industrial and scientific capabilities at the service
    of the war effort.  The Second World War was marked by a large number of
    civilian deaths, the strategic bombing which killed about one million
    people, including the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,     
    The war resulted in an estimated 50 to 85 million deaths;  Therefore, World War
     II is the bloodiest war in human history

        embroidered empire by the Qing and the Britain's symbo
        second, France joined alongside Britain. The reason was China's attempt to
        reduce the opium and the willingness of the pioneers, which resulted in
        Britain, in the face of the big profits that Britain was rented from the opium
        trade in China. The opium war was in 1839 and was out of its results that
        Hong Kong became a British colony. These wars were made of brutal
        massages from the British and their allies, and were all of the religious and
